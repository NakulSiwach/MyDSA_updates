# what is pointer and what is it for.

int a = 5;
int* ptr = &a;
here, ptr stores the address of a (that is hexadecimal) 
and, *ptr give the value of int (or any datatype) present at that address.

* is used to get the value at given memory address.
& is used to get the memory adress of given data. 
size of pointer is always 8 bytes (for all data types pointer)

i.e. when we do cout for following we get,

a = 5
&a = address of a
ptr = address of a    
*ptr = 5


int a = 5;
int *ptr = &a;
*ptr = *ptr+1;
cout<<*ptr;
this will increase 5 to 6

arr[i] = *(arr+i)
